#Create an algorithm that asks user for two integers. Print the sum of the numbers. 
x = int(input("Type an integer number: "))
y = int(input("Type another integer number: "))
res = "The result of the sum of {} and {} is {}.".format(x, y, x +y) #Modern way
print (res)
res = f"The result of the sum of {x} and {y} is {x+y}." #f-string way
print(res)
